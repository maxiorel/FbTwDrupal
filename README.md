# FbTwDrupal
Simple module with Block Plugin which gets latest posts from Facebook page and Twitter profile and then display all of them in one block.

Some improvements will be added later, like displayed posts number or settings form instead of placing the config directly to the code.

Then after checked with Drupal Coding Standards I will try to put it in Drupal.org repository.
